# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — CONNECT

MOTH becomes a cloud service with accounts, usage plans, referrals and a GPU training network.

- **MOTH Server** (new, owner-operated):
  - accounts: Argon2id, email verification and recovery, rate limits, no enumeration, sessions and revocation
  - LK5T Owner with one-time interactive setup and re-authentication for sensitive actions
  - plans with atomic token metering and a credit ledger
  - Stripe subscriptions with verified webhooks (checkout disabled until configured)
  - referrals with pending, capped and reversible rewards
  - training coordinator with worker enrollment, leases and verified contributions
  - model registry with an evaluation gate, deployment and rollback
  - metered MOTH Cloud inference
  - Owner-only server-side content policy, Owner Dashboard API and audit log
- **MOTH Worker** (new): one-command, checksum-pinned Linux GPU enrollment; resumable, resource-limited training;
  systemd service.
- **Desktop:**
  - cloud-only chat and agent with a MOTH account and per-workspace consent
  - Windows Credential Manager sessions, saved accounts and switching
  - Settings → Account, Plan & usage, Referrals
  - Training & Referrals view
  - Owner Dashboard; Owner-only model tools with "Publish to MOTH Cloud"
  - MOTH Cloud status and outage handling
- **Removed** (cloud-only architecture): local inference and model loading, local/auto inference modes, the
  local content-policy editor (now server-side), and the v0.1 Community view (replaced by Training & Referrals).
- **Deployment:** Dockerfile, Compose (PostgreSQL + Caddy TLS), systemd unit, encrypted off-host backups with
  verified restore.
- **CI:** server tests on SQLite and PostgreSQL, Linux worker-install test, Windows Credential Manager test.

## 0.1.0 — Foundation

First release of MOTH Code: the complete pipeline from an empty, randomly initialised network to a desktop coding
agent, with every subsystem implemented and tested. No pretrained model is included.

- Desktop app (Tauri 2, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn-style UI) with MOTH branding: workspace with chat and
  agent modes, explorer, Monaco editor, terminal, Git changes, activity and memory; training dashboard; models and
  inference; learning network; settings.
- MOTH Model: original decoder-only Transformer, presets up to 400M parameters, MOTH-50M at 49.3M; custom byte-level
  BPE tokenizer.
- Training: license-tracked data, mixed precision on CUDA with CPU fallback, checkpoints with exact resume,
  evaluation, export.
- Owner-defined content policy, separate from always-on operational security.
- Autonomous coding engine with permissions, approvals, verification, memory, retrieval, cancel/resume/revert, and
  honest capability reporting.
- Opt-in community learning protocol with validation and aggregation; hybrid local/cloud inference with consent and
  redaction.
- CI on Windows and Linux; Windows installer with bundled backend; signed in-app updates.
